# Todo-list
A todo-list created from 'The Web Development Bootcamp' course from Udemy with Instructor Colt Steele. 

- This Todo-list is simple-made with basic functions for adding a todo-element to the todo-list. 
- It has animations for when deleting or crossing out elements from the list. 

- This todo-list is not connected to a database where the todos are stored. 
  - The deleted elements are simply set to null after the 'trash-icon' is pressed. 
- Crossing over is the 'text-decoration: line-through' attribute via css. 


The documents are not fully commentated as this was a test project.
